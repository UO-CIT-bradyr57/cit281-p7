# Project 7

## Purpose:
The purpose of the project is to create repositories for each project in order to save, and showcase the work. In doing so, I can create a landing page to highlight my work within the CIT minor so far. 

## Technologies Learned:
```markdown
- GitHub
  - Pages
  - Repository
  - cloning
```
## What I learned:
I learned how to customize a GitHub repository to create a page and showcase my work. Building off of that, I was able to clone my completed projects from my local repo onto GitHub.

### Highlights from the Project

Below is the dashboard of my organization that highlights the repositories and information regarding my project.
